This is a small project made for an applied cryptography class. It consists of three scripts written in Python which
aim to implement RSA encryption in a practical context.

The repository has been cleaned up and uploaded here as an academic resource for anybody to peek into.

## Use
```
python keygen.py
python cipher.py --private-key alice.pem --public-key bob.pub -p [password]
python decipher.py --public-key alice.pub --private-key bob.pem -p [password]
```
